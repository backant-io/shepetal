# Manual tests

Steps a person has to run: they need physical keys, a voice, or a permission grant. Automated checks are not repeated here.

## Mac

Setup: `scripts/make-app.sh`, then `open dist/Shepetal.app`. The app is ad-hoc signed, so every rebuild counts as a new app for macOS and the permissions have to be granted again. If the 🌐/fn key opens the emoji picker or starts macOS Dictation, set System Settings > Keyboard > "Press 🌐 key to" to "Do Nothing".

### M-PERM-1: Microphone
1. Quit Shepetal. Run `tccutil reset Microphone io.backant.shepetal`.
2. Open Shepetal. The Permissions window lists Microphone with ⚠️.
3. Click Grant… next to Microphone. macOS asks for microphone access. Allow it.
4. Expected: the row turns ✅ within a second.

### M-PERM-2: Input Monitoring
1. Run `tccutil reset ListenEvent io.backant.shepetal` and open Shepetal.
2. Click Grant… next to Input Monitoring. System Settings opens at Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring. Turn on Shepetal.
3. Expected: the row turns ✅, and within 2 s the 🤫 menu's first line reads "Hold fn to talk, double-tap for hands-free". You don't need to restart.

### M-PERM-3: Accessibility
1. Run `tccutil reset Accessibility io.backant.shepetal` and open Shepetal.
2. Click Grant… next to Accessibility. Allow it in the prompt or in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
3. Expected: the row turns ✅.

### M-PERM-4: no prompts mode
1. Reset all three permissions as above. Run `open dist/Shepetal.app --args --no-permission-prompts`.
2. Expected: no macOS permission dialog appears and no Permissions window opens. 🤫 shows a yellow ring and "Needs Microphone, Input Monitoring, Accessibility" for about 4 s. Pressing fn does nothing.

### M-IND-1: indicator placement
1. With Shepetal running, look at the bottom-left corner of the main display (the one with the menu bar).
2. Expected: a small 🤫 (about 18 pt) about 8 pt from the bottom and left edges, above the Dock.
3. Switch to another Space, then put Safari in full screen. Expected: 🤫 stays in the same corner in both.
4. Click on 🤫. Expected: the click goes to whatever is under it. Shepetal does not take focus.

### M-FN-1: hold to talk
1. Click into a TextEdit document. Hold fn, say "Testing one two three, this is a hold to talk check.", then release.
2. Expected: a red ring while you hold, a pulsing blue ring after release, then the text appears at the cursor. Your earlier clipboard is back (Cmd+V elsewhere pastes what you had copied before).

### M-FN-2: double-tap for hands-free
1. In TextEdit, tap fn twice quickly (the second press within half a second of releasing the first).
2. Expected: the ring turns orange and stays orange after you release.
3. Speak two sentences without holding anything. Tap fn once.
4. Expected: the text appears. Recent in the 🤫 menu shows it.

### M-FN-3: short press
1. Tap fn once, briefly (under half a second), and don't tap again.
2. Expected: nothing is inserted. "Hold fn to talk · double-tap for hands-free" shows next to 🤫 for about 2 s.
3. Expected: Recent in the 🤫 menu has a "(too short)" entry, and a new WAV is in Open recordings folder.

### M-FN-4: fn as a modifier
1. In a long TextEdit document, hold fn and press Down arrow within the first second, keep both held for about 2 s, then release.
2. Expected: the view pages down. No ring stays red, nothing is transcribed or pasted, and no hint shows.
3. Type a word, then press fn+Delete quickly a few times.
4. Expected: characters after the cursor are deleted, nothing is inserted, and no hint shows. Recent in the 🤫 menu has a "(cancelled)" entry for each press, and each has a WAV in Open recordings folder.
5. Hold fn for about 2 s, then press Down arrow while still holding and speaking. Expected: the dictation goes on and is inserted on release.

### M-INS-1: TextEdit
1. Type "Please" in a TextEdit document, leave the cursor right after it, then hold fn and say "Send the report today."
2. Expected: "Please send the report today." The text starts with a space and a lowercase "send".

### M-INS-2: Slack
1. Click into a Slack message box (desktop app). Hold fn, say a sentence, then release.
2. Expected: the sentence appears in the box and is not sent. The clipboard is restored.

### M-INS-3: browser
1. Click into a text field in Safari or Chrome (for example a GitHub comment box). Hold fn, say a sentence, then release.
2. Expected: the sentence appears in the field.

### M-INS-4: paste that does not land
1. Open Activity Monitor and click its process list, so no text field has focus. Hold fn, say a sentence, then release.
2. Expected: a yellow ring and "Paste did not land. The text is in Recent." Clicking the entry in Recent copies the text.

### M-RET-1: delete after 24 hours
1. In the 🤫 menu choose Recordings > Delete recordings after 24 hours.
2. Expected: recordings older than 24 h are gone from the recordings folder right away. Newer ones stay. (The timing itself is covered by `StorageTests.testRetention24hDeletesOnTime`.)

### M-INS-5: space before the following word (F109)
1. In TextEdit type "Hello world", then put the cursor right before "world". Hold fn, say "big", then release.
2. Expected: "Hello big world", with one space on each side of "big".
3. Select "big world" and press Cmd+C. In Terminal run `pbpaste | xxd | head -2`. Expected: `c2 a0` (a non-breaking space) right after "big", not `20`.

### M-INS-6: replace a selection (F109)
1. In TextEdit type "Send the draft today." Double-click "draft". Hold fn, say "Final version.", then release.
2. Expected: "Send the final version today." The new words are lowercase like "draft", and there is no period after them.
3. Select "today." including its period. Hold fn and say "Tomorrow". Expected: "Send the final version tomorrow." with the period kept.
4. Select " version " with the spaces on both sides. Say "copy". Expected: "Send the final copy tomorrow." with no double or missing spaces.

### M-FOC-1: focus goes back to where you started (F27)
1. Open a TextEdit document and Notes. Click into the TextEdit document. Double-tap fn and say a sentence.
2. Click into a Notes note, then tap fn once to stop.
3. Expected: TextEdit comes to the front and the sentence lands in the TextEdit document. Notes gets nothing.
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2, but close the TextEdit document (Don't Save) before tapping fn. Expected: TextEdit comes to the front. With no text field, "Paste did not land. The text is in Recent." shows next to 🤫.
5. Repeat steps 1 and 2, but quit TextEdit before tapping fn. Expected: the sentence lands in the Notes note.

### M-SEC-1: Secure Input (F17)
1. Open Terminal and turn on Terminal > Secure Keyboard Entry. Keep Terminal in front for about 3 s.
2. Expected: "Secure input is on in Terminal, so fn can't be heard" shows next to 🤫 once. It does not come back every 2 s.
3. Still in Terminal, hold fn, speak, then release. Expected: either nothing records (macOS hides fn from Shepetal), or "Secure input is on in Terminal. The text is in Recent." shows, nothing is pasted, the clipboard holds what you copied before, and Recent has the text. Write down which one happened.
4. Click into another app, so Terminal no longer holds secure input. Expected: the note is gone if it was still showing. Click back into Terminal. Expected: the note shows once more.
5. Turn Secure Keyboard Entry off again.

### M-PERM-5: a permission turned off while Shepetal runs (F90)
1. Start Shepetal with all three permissions ✅. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility and turn Shepetal off.
2. Expected: within 2 s, a yellow ring and "Accessibility access was turned off" next to 🤫, and the Permissions window opens with Accessibility ⚠️. The message shows once, not every 2 s.
3. Turn Shepetal back on. Expected: the yellow ring clears within 2 s. Turn it off again. Expected: the message shows again.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 with Microphone and with Input Monitoring. After turning Input Monitoring back on, hold fn in TextEdit and speak. Expected: it records and inserts. If fn does nothing until Shepetal restarts, note it on #32.
5. Quit Shepetal, run `open dist/Shepetal.app --args --no-permission-prompts`, and turn Accessibility off. Expected: the message and the yellow ring show, but no window opens.

### M-LOGIN-1: Open at login (F92)
1. Open the 🤫 menu and choose Open at login.
2. Expected: the item is checked. If macOS wants approval instead, "Allow Shepetal in System Settings > General > Login Items" shows next to 🤫 and System Settings opens at Login Items. Allow Shepetal there. The item is then checked the next time you open the menu.
3. Log out and log back in. Expected: 🤫 is in the bottom-left corner and in the menu bar without you opening Shepetal, and there is no Dock icon.
4. Choose Open at login again. Expected: unchecked, and Shepetal is gone from Login Items. Every `scripts/make-app.sh` build has a new ad-hoc signature, so turn it off and on again after a rebuild.

### M-SND-1: sounds (F06)
1. Turn the volume up. Hold fn, speak, and release. Expected: a short rising blip when the ring turns red and a short falling blip on release. Neither is loud.
2. Double-tap fn. Expected: a quick double blip when the ring turns orange. Tap fn to stop: the falling blip.
3. Press fn+Delete. Expected: a low tone. Tap fn briefly once. Expected: no sound, only the hint.
4. Play the newest WAV in Open recordings folder. The start blip may be faint at the very start. Expected: the transcript in Recent has no extra word from it.
5. Uncheck Sounds in the 🤫 menu. Expected: steps 1 to 3 make no sound. Quit and reopen Shepetal: Sounds is still unchecked.
