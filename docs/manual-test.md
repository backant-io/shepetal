# Manual tests

Steps a person has to run: they need physical keys, a voice, or a permission grant. Automated checks are not repeated here.

## Mac

Setup: `scripts/make-app.sh`, then `open dist/Shepetal.app`. The app is ad-hoc signed, so every rebuild counts as a new app for macOS and the permissions have to be granted again. If the 🌐/fn key opens the emoji picker or starts macOS Dictation, set System Settings > Keyboard > "Press 🌐 key to" to "Do Nothing".

### M-PERM-1: Microphone
1. Quit Shepetal. Run `tccutil reset Microphone io.backant.shepetal`.
2. Open Shepetal. The Permissions window lists Microphone with ⚠️.
3. Click Grant… next to Microphone. macOS asks for microphone access. Allow it.
4. Expected: the row turns ✅ within a second.

### M-PERM-2: Input Monitoring
1. Run `tccutil reset ListenEvent io.backant.shepetal` and open Shepetal.
2. Click Grant… next to Input Monitoring. System Settings opens at Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring. Turn on Shepetal.
3. Expected: the row turns ✅, and within 2 s the 🤫 menu's first line reads "Hold fn to talk, double-tap for hands-free". You don't need to restart.

### M-PERM-3: Accessibility
1. Run `tccutil reset Accessibility io.backant.shepetal` and open Shepetal.
2. Click Grant… next to Accessibility. Allow it in the prompt or in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
3. Expected: the row turns ✅.

### M-PERM-4: no prompts mode
1. Reset all three permissions as above. Run `open dist/Shepetal.app --args --no-permission-prompts`.
2. Expected: no macOS permission dialog appears and no Permissions window opens. 🤫 shows a yellow ring and "Needs Microphone, Input Monitoring, Accessibility" for about 4 s. Pressing fn does nothing.

### M-IND-1: indicator placement
1. With Shepetal running, look at the bottom-left corner of the main display (the one with the menu bar).
2. Expected: a small 🤫 (about 18 pt) about 8 pt from the bottom and left edges, above the Dock.
3. Switch to another Space, then put Safari in full screen. Expected: 🤫 stays in the same corner in both.
4. Click on 🤫. Expected: the click goes to whatever is under it. Shepetal does not take focus.
5. Tap fn once briefly. Expected: the hint shows to the right of 🤫, and 🤫 itself does not move. When the hint goes, 🤫 stays (idle has no ring).
(The frame, the panel flags, the hint timing and the ring colours are covered by `IndicatorTests`. This step checks them on a real display, Space and full-screen app.)

### M-FN-1: hold to talk
1. Click into a TextEdit document. Hold fn, say "Testing one two three, this is a hold to talk check.", then release.
2. Expected: a red ring while you hold, a pulsing blue ring after release, then the text appears at the cursor. Your earlier clipboard is back (Cmd+V elsewhere pastes what you had copied before).

### M-FN-2: double-tap for hands-free
1. In TextEdit, tap fn twice quickly (the second press within half a second of releasing the first).
2. Expected: the ring turns orange and stays orange after you release.
3. Speak two sentences without holding anything. Tap fn once.
4. Expected: the text appears. Recent in the 🤫 menu shows it.

### M-FN-3: short press
1. Tap fn once, briefly (under half a second), and don't tap again.
2. Expected: nothing is inserted. "Hold fn to talk · double-tap for hands-free" shows next to 🤫 for about 2 s.
3. Expected: Recent in the 🤫 menu has a "(too short)" entry, and a new WAV is in Open recordings folder.

### M-FN-4: fn as a modifier
1. In a long TextEdit document, hold fn and press Down arrow within the first second, keep both held for about 2 s, then release.
2. Expected: the view pages down. No ring stays red, nothing is transcribed or pasted, and no hint shows.
3. Type a word, then press fn+Delete quickly a few times.
4. Expected: characters after the cursor are deleted, nothing is inserted, and no hint shows. Recent in the 🤫 menu has a "(cancelled)" entry for each press, and each has a WAV in Open recordings folder.
5. Hold fn for about 2 s, then press Down arrow while still holding and speaking. Expected: the dictation goes on and is inserted on release.

### M-INS-1: TextEdit
1. Type "Please" in a TextEdit document, leave the cursor right after it, then hold fn and say "Send the report today."
2. Expected: "Please send the report today." The text starts with a space and a lowercase "send".

### M-INS-2: Slack
1. Click into a Slack message box (desktop app). Hold fn, say a sentence, then release.
2. Expected: the sentence appears in the box and is not sent. The clipboard is restored.

### M-INS-3: browser
1. Click into a text field in Safari or Chrome (for example a GitHub comment box). Hold fn, say a sentence, then release.
2. Expected: the sentence appears in the field.

### M-INS-4: paste that does not land
1. Open Activity Monitor and click its process list, so no text field has focus. Hold fn, say a sentence, then release.
2. Expected: a yellow ring and "Paste did not land. The text is in Recent." Clicking the entry in Recent copies the text.

### M-NS-1: no speech
1. Copy a word in TextEdit (Cmd+C), then click into the document. In a quiet room, hold fn for about 2 s without speaking, then release.
2. Expected: nothing is inserted. A yellow ring and "No speech heard" show for about 4 s. Cmd+V still pastes the word you copied.
3. Expected: Recent in the 🤫 menu has a "(no speech)" entry, and a new WAV is in Open recordings folder.
4. Hold fn, say only "um, uh", then release. Expected: the same as steps 2 and 3.
5. Hold fn and say a quiet "yes" from about an arm's length away. Expected: "yes" is inserted. If it shows "No speech heard" instead, or room noise in step 1 got transcribed, the -60 dBFS floor does not fit this mic: note the mic and the room in #15. You can try another floor with `defaults write io.backant.shepetal speechFloorDb -float -65` and relaunch.

### M-RET-1: delete after 24 hours
1. In the 🤫 menu choose Recordings > Delete recordings after 24 hours.
2. Expected: recordings older than 24 h are gone from the recordings folder right away. Newer ones stay. (The timing itself is covered by `StorageTests.testRetention24hDeletesOnTime`.)

### M-HUB-1: open the Shepetal window
1. Before you install this build, run `sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Shepetal/history.sqlite 'select count(*) from history'` and note the number. Install and open the new build. Run the command again. Expected: the same number. (`HistoryTests.testOldDatabaseUpgradesWithoutLosingRows` checks this on a copy of the old schema.)
2. With all three permissions granted, quit Shepetal and open it again from Finder or Spotlight. Expected: only 🤫 appears. No Shepetal window opens.
3. Open the 🤫 menu and choose Open Shepetal…. Expected: a window titled "Shepetal" with Home, History and Settings tabs comes to the front.
4. Close it. Open `dist/Shepetal.app` again (Finder, Spotlight or `open dist/Shepetal.app`). Expected: the same window opens. No second 🤫 appears.
5. Home: expected rows for the speech model, the fn key ("Watched…" once Input Monitoring is on), and the missing permissions with Open Permissions…. Each Donate link opens its page in the browser.

### M-HUB-2: search and copy
1. Dictate "Send the quarterly report today" and then "Call the dentist at 100% volume" into TextEdit (M-FN-1). Open History.
2. Type `QUARTERLY` in Search. Expected: only the first dictation is listed. Type `100%`. Expected: only the second. Clear the field. Expected: both, newest first.
3. Click Copy on the first, then Cmd+V in TextEdit. Expected: its text.

### M-HUB-3: play, and recordings that are gone
1. Click Play on a dictation. Expected: you hear that recording.
2. In the recordings folder (Settings > Open recordings folder), run `touch -t 202001010000 <file>.wav` on one recording, then choose Settings > Recordings > Delete recordings after 24 hours.
3. Expected: that row now says "recording deleted", its Play and Re-transcribe are greyed out, and its text and Copy still work. Set Recordings back to Keep recordings if you want.

### M-HUB-4: re-transcribe
1. Click Re-transcribe on a dictation and choose the entry marked "(current)". Expected: "Re-transcribed with parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3" under the list. The row keeps its time, outcome and app.
2. Install the whisper.cpp fallback (README, Mac). Choose the other model in the same menu. Expected: after a few seconds, "Re-transcribed with ggml-…", and the row's text is the whisper result. Without the fallback installed, expected: "Re-transcribe failed: … not found", and the row is unchanged.

### M-HUB-5: archive
1. Click Archive on a dictation. Expected: it leaves the list.
2. Tick Show archived. Expected: it is back, marked "archived", with Unarchive. Click Unarchive and untick Show archived. Expected: it stays in the list.

### M-HUB-6: settings
1. In Settings, set Recordings to Delete recordings after 24 hours. Expected: the 🤫 menu's Recordings submenu shows the same choice.
2. Open recordings folder opens Finder at the audio folder. Permissions… opens the Permissions window.

### M-CTX-1: app and page URL
1. Dictate into TextEdit, into a text field in Safari, and into a text field in Chrome (for example a GitHub comment box).
2. Open History. Expected: the rows show "TextEdit", "Safari · github.com" and "Google Chrome · github.com". The URL is stored only in `history.sqlite` (`sqlite3 … 'select app, bundle_id, url from history order by created_at desc limit 3'`).
3. If a Chrome row has no host, note it on the PR: Chrome had no accessibility tree for the page (see the `ponytail:` note in `Sources/Shepetal/AppContext.swift`).
4. With Chrome in front on a heavy page (a long GitHub pull request), tap fn quickly five times, waiting 2 s after each tap. Expected: each tap shows the short-press hint and nothing is inserted. The page-URL lookup runs off the main thread, so a slow page must not turn a tap into a hold.
